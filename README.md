# timezone-vpn-detection
Based On : [ujjwal-kr/EpicTracker](https://github.com/ujjwal-kr/ip-sniff)

Demo: https://ujjwal-kr.github.io/timezone-vpn-detection

I created (invented ?) a VPN detection demo with timezones. This is unstable but should sometimes detect VPN connections from another country.
